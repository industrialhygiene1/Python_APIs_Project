#Observations
## - As would be expected, temperatures this time of year are higher near the equator and in the southern hemisphere (where it is summer)
## - Humidity id higher on the equator and northern hemispheres likely due to normal conditions during this time of year. Likely shift in the northern hemisphere's summer
## - When first running, will try to remove by re-running before due, there was an extreme outlier  for the city of Paita, PE with a humidity reading of 290. Likely a reporting issue.
## - More clouds and winds in the northern hemisphere likely due to winder conditions in the northern hemisphere.
